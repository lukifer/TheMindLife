## The Mind: Unofficial Life-Tracker

I wanted an easy way to track lives and stars for the card game [The Mind](https://www.pandasaurusgames.com/product/the-mind/), so I made one! Demo here: https://lukifer.github.io/TheMindLife/ (real URL coming soon)

Still a work in progress, and requires touch events to work. Swipe left and right to change levels, etc.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
