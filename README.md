## The Mind: Unofficial Life-Tracker

https://themind.gg

I wanted an easy, portable way to track lives and stars for the card game [The Mind](https://www.pandasaurusgames.com/product/the-mind/), so I made one! Swipe left and right to change levels, lives and stars (or, use the arrows if your device doesn't support touch). Also supports a mode for [The Mind Extreme](https://www.pandasaurusgames.com/product/the-mind-extreme/).
